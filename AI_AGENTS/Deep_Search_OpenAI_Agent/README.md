Deep_Search_OpenAI_Agent# Deep Research OpenAI Agent 🔍

An intelligent AI-powered research assistant that performs comprehensive deep research on any topic using OpenAI's agent framework. This application leverages multiple AI agents working together to gather, analyze, and synthesize information into detailed research reports.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Deep Research**: Conducts thorough research on any topic automatically
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized agents for different research tasks
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with Gradio for easy interaction
- **Real-time Streaming**: Shows research progress as it happens
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed, well-structured research reports

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application uses an agentic framework with the following components:

- **Research Manager**: Orchestrates the research workflow and coordinates multiple agents
- **Deep Research Module**: Handles the core research logic and agent coordination
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly Gradio interface for queries and results

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection for research capabilities

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd AI_Agents_app/AI_AGENTS/Deep_Search_OpenAI_Agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Gradio web interface:

```bash
python deep_research.py
```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:7860`

### Using the Interface

1. Enter your research topic in the text box
2. Click the "Run" button or press Enter
3. Watch as the AI agent performs deep research
4. View the comprehensive research report as it's generated in real-time

### Example Queries

- "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
- "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare"
- "Compare different renewable energy technologies"
- "What are the best practices for microservices architecture?"
