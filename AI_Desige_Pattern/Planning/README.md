- `planning_crewai.py` - Planning pattern using CrewAI framework
- `openai_agent_planning.py` - Advanced planning with OpenAI Agents SDK

## üéØ What is the Planning Design Pattern?

The Planning Design Pattern is a multi-phase approach where AI agents:

1. **Plan Phase** - Break down complex tasks into structured subtasks
2. **Execution Phase** - Execute the plan using specialized tools/agents
3. **Synthesis Phase** - Combine results into comprehensive output

```

### Key Benefits

- **Structured Thinking**: Forces agents to think before acting
- **Better Quality**: Planned approach yields more comprehensive results
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into agent's reasoning process
- **Flexibility**: Plans can be adjusted based on intermediate results
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities

## üìù Example 1: Simple Planning with CrewAI (`planning_crewai.py`)

### Overview
A straightforward implementation showing basic planning pattern for content creation using CrewAI.

### How It Works

**Single Agent Approach:**
- Agent plans the content structure first
- Then writes based on that plan
- Combines planning and execution in one agent

### Code Structure

```python
# Agent with both planning and writing responsibilities
planner_writer_agent = Agent(
    role='Article Planner and Writer',
    goal='Plan and then write a concise, engaging summary',
    backstory='Expert technical writer and content strategist',
    llm=llm
)

# Task with explicit planning instruction
task = Task(
    description="""
    1. Create a bullet-point plan
    2. Write summary based on plan
    """,
    expected_output="""
    ### Plan
    - Bulleted outline
    
    ### Summary
    - Final content
    """
)
```

### Features
- Simple sequential process
- Single agent handles both phases
- Clear output structure with plan and content
- Uses Groq's Qwen model

### Running the Example

```bash
python planning_crewai.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
## Task Result ##

### Plan
- Define reinforcement learning
- Explain importance in AI
- Provide real-world applications
- Discuss future potential

### Summary
Reinforcement learning is a crucial AI paradigm where agents learn optimal 
behaviors through trial and error...
```

## üîß Customization Guide

### Adding New Research Tools

```python
@function_tool
def analyze_social_media(product_category: str) -> SocialInsight:
    """Analyze social media sentiment and trends"""
    return SocialInsight(
        sentiment_score=0.75,
        trending_topics=["AI fitness", "personalization"],
        engagement_rate="High"
    )

# Add to execution agent
execution_agent = Agent(
    tools=[
        analyze_market_size,
        research_competitors,
        gather_customer_insights,
        assess_regulatory_environment,
        analyze_social_media  # New tool
    ]
)
```

### Modifying Plan Structure

```python
# Add more subtasks
planning_instructions = """
Create a research plan with 6 subtasks:
1. Market analysis
2. Competitor research
3. Customer insights
4. Regulatory assessment
5. Social media analysis  # New
6. Technology assessment  # New
"""
```

### Switching LLM Providers

```python
# Use OpenAI instead of Groq
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
llm = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
    model="gpt-4o-mini", 
    openai_client=openai_client
)
```

| **Customization** | Easy | Highly flexible |

## üéì When to Use Planning Pattern

### ‚úÖ Good Use Cases

- **Research Tasks**: Market analysis, competitive intelligence
- **Content Creation**: Long-form articles, reports, documentation
- **Project Planning**: Software development, product launches
- **Data Analysis**: Multi-source data collection and synthesis
- **Decision Making**: Complex decisions requiring multiple factors

### ‚ùå Not Ideal For

- **Simple Queries**: "What's the weather?" doesn't need planning
- **Real-time Responses**: Planning adds latency
- **Single-step Tasks**: "Translate this text" is straightforward
- **Creative Exploration**: Sometimes constraints hurt creativity

## üîÆ Advanced Patterns

### Adaptive Planning

```python
# Plan can be modified during execution based on findings
async def adaptive_planning(initial_plan):
    plan = initial_plan
    for step in plan.subtasks:
        result = await execute_step(step)
        if result.needs_deeper_research:
            plan = await replan(plan, result)
    return final_results
```

### Hierarchical Planning

```python
# High-level plan ‚Üí Detailed sub-plans
high_level_plan = await create_strategic_plan()
for task in high_level_plan.tasks:
    detailed_plan = await create_tactical_plan(task)
    await execute_detailed_plan(detailed_plan)
```

### Collaborative Planning

```python
# Multiple agents contribute to the plan
marketing_plan = await marketing_agent.plan()
technical_plan = await technical_agent.plan()
final_plan = await coordinator.merge_plans([marketing_plan, technical_plan])
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Planning Agent Creates Invalid Plans**
```python
# Add validation to plan output
class ResearchPlan(BaseModel):
    subtasks: List[ResearchSubtask]
    
    @validator('subtasks')
    def validate_subtasks(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 3:
            raise ValueError("Plan must have at least 3 subtasks")
        return v
```

**2. Execution Phase Fails**
```python
# Add error handling
try:
    result = await Runner.run(executor, input)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Execution failed: {e}")
    # Fallback or retry logic
```

**3. Synthesis Produces Generic Output**
```python
# Improve synthesis instructions
synthesis_instructions = """
Base your analysis ONLY on the provided research data.
Cite specific numbers and findings.
Avoid generic statements without evidence.
"""
```

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent research tasks in parallel
2. **Caching**: Cache research results to avoid redundant API calls
3. **Streaming**: Stream intermediate results for better UX
4. **Token Optimization**: Use concise prompts to reduce costs

## üîó Related Patterns

- **Reflection Pattern**: Use planning + reflection for better quality
- **Parallelization Pattern**: Execute plan steps in parallel
- **Routing Pattern**: Route to different planners based on task type
